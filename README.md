- Include a "Change Ownership" button on the list detail page to enable the list owner to  transfer ownership within shared lists.
- Add a feature to remove all items from the grocery list at once for convenient list clearing.
- Enable user-defined categories in the application's settings, allowing customization of grocery list categories.
- Make the grocery item category field an enum and update it with user-defined categories on the front end for consistent item categorization.
- Implement image upload functionality for each item to enhance visual identification in the grocery list.
- Add an "Added By" column in the list table to display the contributor of each item in shared lists, providing transparency and accountability.
- Evaluate and revise the home page to align it with the overall application design and functionality, considering its removal if necessary.
